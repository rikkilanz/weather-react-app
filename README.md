# React Weather App

This app uses OpenWeatherAPI to display information about the weather.

There are two link for different API fetches, but both are from the same creator (OpenWeather). One uses the current weather call API and the other uses a 3-hour step forecast API data fetch.

## Future features:
1. Search functionality - the ability to search your preferred location weather
2. Geolocation - the app can define where you're currently located at an will load the weather base on your current location
3. Dynamic message update - message component displays different messages depending on weather.
